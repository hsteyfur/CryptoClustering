# CryptoClustering
Overview
This homework aims to explore and apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to a given dataset. In this homework I focused on understanding and implementing algorithms such as K-means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Dimensionality Reduction. The tasks will help develop a deeper understanding of clustering methods, feature extraction, and data visualization.
